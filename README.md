# Managing Virtual Infrastructure using GOVC 

govc is a vSphere CLI built on top of govmomi.

The CLI is designed to be a user friendly CLI alternative to the GUI and well suited for automation tasks. It also acts as a test harness for the govmomi APIs and provides working examples of how to use the APIs.

## Installation

You can find prebuilt govc binaries on the releases page.

Download and install a binary locally like this:
